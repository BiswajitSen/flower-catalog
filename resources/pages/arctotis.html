            Arctotis is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the family Asteraceae.
            Arctotis is native to dry stony slopes in southern Africa. Some of the plants
            are alternatively placed in the genus Venidium. The common name is "African
            daisy", or "Gousblom" in Afrikaans. These plants have daisy-like composite
            flowers which tend to close in the late afternoon or in dull weather, but
            numerous cultivars have been developed for garden use which stay open for
            longer, and are available in a wide range of colours. Tender perennials are
            often grown in temperate regions as half-hardy annuals. The garden hybrid A.
            hybrida hort. 'Flame' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of
            Garden Merit. Vigorous Arctotis hybrids like 'Pink Sugar' and 'Large Marge'
            are popular choices for garden design for the diverse colors of their blooms.

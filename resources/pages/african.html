            African Violets are one of the most popular plants for indoor gardens. Most
            species naturally live in the mountains, usually under the cover of other
            plants. Because of this, they require moderate temperatures and light, which
            can easily be found and controlled inside of homes. However, some indoor
            gardeners shy away from growing them because their care can be intimidating.
            These plants come in almost every color and have a frilly or fringed texture
            to the petals. They will bloom nearly every day if in bright and dependable
            lighting. The foliage is typically green or variegated, with a slight fuzz in
            texture.

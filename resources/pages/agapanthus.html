            Agapanthus praecox (common agapanthus, blue lily, African lily, or lily of the
            Nile) is a popular garden plant around the world, especially in Mediterranean
            climates. It is native to the Kwa-Zulu Natal and Western Cape provinces of
            South Africa. Local names include agapant, bloulelie, isicakathi and ubani.[1]
            Most of the cultivated plants of the genus Agapanthus are hybrids or cultivars
            of this species. It is divided into three subspecies: subsp.praecox, subsp.
            orientalis and subsp. minimus. Agapanthus praecox is a variable species with
            open-faced flowers. It is a perennial plant that can live for up to 75 years.
            Its evergreen leaves are 2 cm wide and 50 cm long. Its inflorescence is an
            umbel. The flowers are blue, purple or white and bloom from late spring to
            summer, followed by capsules filled with black seeds. Its flowering stem
            reaches one meter high. Its roots are very powerful and can break concrete.
